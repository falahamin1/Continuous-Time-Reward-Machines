Code debugging and improvement: 
    - Increase the size of the neural network for DQN. Our reference paper uses three hidden layers with 1024
      Relu units in each layer. Right now our size is 2 hidden layers with 128 Relu units. 
    - Keeping epsilon constant than decay; The reference paper uses a constant epsilon (0.1) while we use 
      exponential decay with min epsilon 0.1 . 
    - Keeping a high learning rate; The learning rate of the reference paper is 0.5 while we use 0.1 as 
      the learning rate. I am not sure if this is a good idea as it might cause the algorithm not to converge.
    - Understanding why CRM does not work in the firefighter example. Changing the reward machine of the fire
      fighter example so that the ordering of the objective is not in play. 
    - Maybe adding reward shaping to the mix
